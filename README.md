Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. Each tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the data and features, and the final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all trees (for regression) or by majority voting (for classification). Random Forest is robust against noise and overfitting, and it handles both categorical and continuous data efficiently. It is widely used in tasks such as classification, regression, and feature importance ranking.

This dataset contains information about celestial objects, including their id, spkid (space object identifier), diameter, albedo (reflectivity), orbit parameters, and more, with the target variable potentially being class (classification of the object). By applying Random Forest, we aim to classify celestial objects based on their physical and orbital characteristics. The findings can help in understanding the properties of asteroids or other space objects and predicting their behavior or class based on their orbital data.
